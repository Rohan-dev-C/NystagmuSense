# NystagmuSense

--- 

Swift Application that can test Contrast Sensitivity Function.

Optokinetic nystagmus is a reflex of the nervous system when a person is tracking an object‬
‭across their visual field. This tracking leads to abnormal movement of the eyes, a smooth tracking‬
‭followed by a series of twitches in the contralateral direction. This phenomenon can be induced by‬
‭physical stimuli, opening doors for potential uses in an optometry clinic. One potential use can be seen in‬
‭measuring someone’s contrast sensitivity function, a robust, but often overlooked, marker of visual‬
‭function. The machine used to measure this function is a visual field machine, which is extremely costly‬
‭to maintain from a money and space perspective. Using a dynamic stimulus on a smartphone, we can‬
‭induce an optokinetic reflex in the user, and using eye tracking, measure the exact point they are no longer‬
‭induced. Advances in camera technology, specifically on mobile phones, have allowed for eye tracking to‬
‭become a viable method to do this. The app then takes the moment when the user stops tracking the‬
‭phone and compares it with the luminance value of the screen before. This value is from 1 to 100, and‬
‭after taking the common log of that value, it directly correlates to the user’s expected contrast sensitivity‬
‭function.‬
